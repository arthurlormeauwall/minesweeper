# Minesweeper

Here is a clone of Minesweeper game that I develop using mostly React.

You can play it here : https://arthurlormeauwall.github.io/minesweeper/

If you want to run the code on your local machine, you have to install npm and clone this repo.
Then, just run :
  `npm install` 
and 
   `npm start`
   
  
   
   Here is a screenshot :
